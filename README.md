## Game of Life BBC technical test exercise by Nathan Pope

This project contains code for The Game Of Life as detailed in the Game of Life Candidate Instructions.

### Several assumptions were made about the problem including:

    1. Limited Grid size - An infinite 2D grid was not feasible so a limited grid size was implemented.
    2. Grid seeding options - Randomised seeding and manual seeding were implemented to allow users to either quickly start the game with a random cell states or manually toggle cell states to customise their own grid patterns.
    3. Cell evolution - Users can choose to iterate life cycles one step at a time or run quick automatic iterations.
    4. Reset the grid - Users may want to restart the game. To facilitate this a reset button was added to quickly clear the grid of all live cells.

### Instructions

    - To begin the game, open the index.html page in your web browser.
    - Click on grid cells to toggle cells to alive or dead.
    - The Random Seed button will fill the grid with a randomised set of cells.
    - Clicking the Next Iteration button evolves the current grid cells to the next life cycle.
    - The Start button runs automatic life cycles and the Stop button ends it.
    - Use the Reset button to clear all live cells from the grid.
